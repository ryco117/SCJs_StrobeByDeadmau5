# StrobeCircleJerk's 'Strobe by Deadmau5'

## About 
A chrome extension to replace all words with 'Strobe By Deadmau5', and play that auditory kashmir on repeat.
Inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/strobecirclejerk/comments/askw0q/we_need_a_strobe_google_chrome_add_on/) by [u/crazzzzzzzy_person](https://www.reddit.com/user/crazzzzzzzy_person).
As Strobe by Deadmau5 is the greatest enitity in existence, I am not wholly sure how the internet was usable before this extension...
